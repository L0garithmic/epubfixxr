If you are finding issues, or there is a newer EPUBCHECK delete the "lib" folder
then replace "epubcheck.jar" and the "lib" folder in the root dir with new ones.

Also bundled is v19.00 of 7zip. Same as with EPUBCheck. If you want a different 7z, replace the 7z.exe

Updates being done. New release coming soon.
